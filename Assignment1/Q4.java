//4.Problem statement
//        You have been given two binary strings ‘A’ and ‘B’. Your task is to find the sum of both strings in the form of a binary string.
//        Binary strings are the representation of integers in the binary form. For example, the binary strings of 9 and 16 are “1001” and “10000” respectively.
//        ‘A’ and ‘B’ consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
//        Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself
//        Time limit: 1 sec
//        Sample Input 1:
//        2
//        2 2
//        10 01
//        3 2
//        111 10
//        Sample Output 1:
//        11
//        1001
//        Explanation of sample input 1:
//        In the first test case, the first string is “10” which is 2 in the decimal format, and the second string is “01” which is 1 in the decimal format. So, 2 + 1 = 3, which is represented as “11” in binary form.
//
//        In the first test case, the first string is “111” which is 7 in the decimal format, and the second string is “10” which is 2 in the decimal format. So, 7 + 2 = 9, which is represented as “1001” in binary form.
//        Sample Input 2:
//        2
//        3 1
//        111 0
//        1 1
//        1 1
//        Sample Output 2:
//        111
//        10
//        Explanation for sample input 2:
//        In the first test case, the first string is “111” which is 7 in the decimal format, and the second string is “0” which is 0 in the decimal format. So, 7 + 0 = 0, which is represented as “111” in binary form.
//
//        In the first test case, the first string is “1” which is 1 in the decimal format and the second string is “1” which is 1 in the decimal format. So, 1 + 1 = 2, which is represented as “10” in binary form.
